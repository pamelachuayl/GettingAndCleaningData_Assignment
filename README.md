README
===================

This is to explain how the run_analysis.R file works.

1. Firstly, please make sure that you have the Samsung data already loaded in your current working directory
2. Obtain and download the run_analysis.R from the github repo
3. Use source('run_analysis.R') to run the script
4. You should now find a tidyData.txt in your working directory
5. To load the data, use the following command: tidydata <- read.table("tidyData.txt", header=T). You should now find the tidydata with dimension 180 by 68 loaded in your environment.
